# SNPs-associated-with-fluconazole-resistance
 Using the yeast model, we produced fluconazole-resistant strains via screening. Investigating resistance mechanisms, we identified SNPs linked to fluconazole resistance, notably in PDR1. We further explored PDR1 and ASG1's roles in resistance using protein interaction data and literature.


The **VCF** file contains information about Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and their genomic positions. 
**ANNOVAR results** store gene annotations for the SNPs. 
**Funcoup gene network results** display the relevant network between the genes of interest and ERG pathway genes. 
The **protein** file stores protein-protein interaction data predicted using AlphaFold2 in PDB format.
