# SNPs-associated-with-fluconazole-resistance
 Using the yeast model, we produced fluconazole-resistant strains via screening. Investigating resistance mechanisms, we identified SNPs linked to fluconazole resistance, notably in PDR1. We further explored PDR1 and ASG1's roles in resistance using protein interaction data and literature.
